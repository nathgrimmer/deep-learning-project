*Deep Learning project* 

This project was carried out by Nathan Grimmer as part of the deep learning course taught at ISAE-Supaero.

The purpose of this exercise is to create an educational video and code demonstration presenting an article. I chose an article about [Pangu-Weather: A 3D High-Resolution System for Fast and Accurate Global Weather Forecast](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.02556).
